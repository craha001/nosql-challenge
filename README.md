# nosql-challenge
For this weeks module 12 challenge, we worked with MongoDB to perform NoSQL queries. A food magazine called, "Eat,Safe,Love," reached out in order for us to evaluate some ratings data
in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. 

## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
For this part, please open the NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb
