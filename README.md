# nosql-challenge
For this weeks module 12 challenge, we worked with MongoDB to perform NoSQL queries. A food magazine called, "Eat,Safe,Love," reached out in order for us to evaluate some ratings data
in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. 

## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
For this part, please open the NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb. Here we have imported the data provided in the resources file using our terminal and it can actually be imported
using jupyter notebook as well. Once the instance of the mongo client was created and the database information was confirmed we can move on to updating the DataBase.

## Part 2: Update the Database
In this section we are still using the NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb. The magazine editors required some modifications to the database. First of which was adding a new halal restaurant which just opened up in 
Greenwich meaning it must be added to the database. Then they were no longer interested in any establishments in Dover, so any establishments found in Dover using the latitude and logitude of the location
were removed. 

## Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
For our analysis please open up the NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb file. The following are the questions that were answered:

1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
